                Milwaukee-based ink / ballpoint pen and digital artist showcases 
                mundane and sometimes comical observations from the current social climate.

                Deusclaw recently finished a 30-day illustration challenge which 
                consisted on capturing objects around his and his girlfriend's 
                one-bedroom appartment in Milwaukee. The illustration is intended
                to capture how these objects end up becoming more than objects as 
                quarantine becomes longer, and we become more attached to their warmth and utility.

                A documentation of Deusclaw's latest illustrations and sketches can be seen in his 
                social media channels.

                        I'm currently posting my work in progress, quick illustrations,
                        sketches, and ideas to Instagram. The speed at which I can share 
                        my work using my phone is incredible and helpful to stay connected
                        with my Instagram following and keep growing in this journey.

                        I've used Behance since 2011. It's a wonderful tool to have an online
                        portfolio. It encourages to share more than one image and really provide
                        a detail description of the idea, the process and the final result. It's 
                        something that I find very important to keep track of.
